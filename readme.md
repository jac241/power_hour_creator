Easily create video or audio power hours from YouTube videos. Add your urls, pick start times, add an intermission with the full song option, and create your power hour.

Power Hour Creator automatically downloads the videos, cuts them to 60 seconds, and merges them into one file for you. Use the import and export options to share the power hour tracklists.
